# ETF BaseX Adapters & Extensions

ETF adapter and extension functions for BaseX-based test projects.

## Build

Build the library with `./gradlew build`.
You can publish the library by uploading it to the interactive instruments
repository with `./gradlew uploadArchives` (NOTE: the repository does not allow
the overwriting of existing libraries so make sure to increment the library
version in the version.properties file).
